/*
If i want to save changes:
	* Commit changes and write a message of what was done (Commit means upload internally but aside from the main GIT image)
	* Push the commit to the repository (Push means upload externally)

 
	* Think of a commit as a snapshot of your program - GIT actually only saves the changes that you make - it does not rewrite everything but only what needs to be changed
	* Think of a PULL as a download of the main image - which you then clone 
	* Think of cloning as making a local copy which you may later push back to the remote
	* Think of the remote as the external git server
